# Control Panel Documentation Plugin

## Documentation

This is the configuration for the plugin that shows the documentation that you're currently reading. There's no official documentation for it, but the individual descriptions for the values here hopefully suffice.

The default values in here are good for "read only" operation, many of the settings are only needed if you
want to regenerate files for a new version (which you probably don't want) or if you want to retrieve the
documentation link from somewhere within your own infrastructure instead of Olaf's server or github repository.
You're welcome to do so, but will have to update the documentation and links yourself.

If you don't remember where you got this plugin: It's available on [Liferay's Marketplace](https://web.liferay.com/marketplace/-/mp/application/170064253)
