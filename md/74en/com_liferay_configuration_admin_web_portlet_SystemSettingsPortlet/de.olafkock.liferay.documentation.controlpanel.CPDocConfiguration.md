# Control Panel Documentation Plugin

## Documentation

This is the configuration for the plugin that shows the documentation that you're currently reading. There's no official documentation for it, but the individual descriptions for the values here hopefully suffice.

The plugin connects to this URL and retrieves the directory of content. You're welcome to host your own directory or mirror the original one - just change the URL here. Note: If you're mirroring the json directory of content, it contains lots of links that are used to display content like this.

If this server can't be reached when the directory is attempted to be read, a static internal copy will be used.

If you don't remember where you got this plugin: It's available on [Liferay's Marketplace](https://web.liferay.com/marketplace/-/mp/application/170064253)
