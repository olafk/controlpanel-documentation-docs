## Community Resources

* From [Community Slack](https://liferay-community.slack.com) (Tomáš Polešovský): If you're configuring a role with permissions to manage Announcements and Alerts, you'll find _only some_ of the required permissions under "Announcements", but others distributed under "General Permissions" (Permission: "Add General Announcement"), as well as under "Site", "Organization", "UserGroup" and "Role" (Permission: "Manage Announcements") - use the one with the correct scope.
