This is a plugin that simply visualizes translated values on a page with their original keys. Purpose: If you find an issue with the translation, it might be easier to locate the original language key rather than the translated message.
It's meant for Development Systems and take several shortcuts that shouldn't be deployed in production systems. Besides, it's ugly, but functional ;)
