## Note

CMIS Store is not suitable for production use and is deprecated as of Liferay DXP Digital Enterprise 7.0 Fix Pack 14 (SP3) and Liferay Portal CE 7.0 GA4. Because it can have performance issues with large repositories, itâ€™s recommended that you use one of the other configuration repositories listed above, such as Advanced File System Store, to store your Documents and Media files.
