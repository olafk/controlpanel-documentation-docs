# Control Panel Documentation

This project holds the raw files that serve as pointers for the documentation for various Liferay-ControlPanel (and Site Administration) applications. 

The [plugin that shows them](https://github.com/olafk/liferay-documentation-workspace) will show you the required documents with their primary and secondary keys. New files will need to be registered in the plugin's configuration(content.json) as well.

Pullrequests welcome, note that they might be edited with regards to sites that they link to (e.g. community resources).

Please concentrate on linking existing resources and only very brief summaries for topics - actual content should be authored in different places. 

The plugin is available for Liferay 7.2 to 7.4. As both are quite similar, the 7.2 documentation has been carried over to 7.3 and then to 7.4. Where you see documentation for a previous version, it's likely still applicable. But the documentation is being migrated from help.liferay.com to learn.liferay.com, and completely restructured in that process. Please help correcting the old links to more current documentation from learn.liferay.com if you come across it. Also, please link community resources if you are aware of some.
