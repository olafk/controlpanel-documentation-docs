# Control Panel Documentation

This project holds the raw files that serve as pointers for the 
documentation for various Liferay-ControlPanel applications. 

The plugin that shows them will show you the required documents
with their primary and secondary keys. New files will need to be
registered in the plugin's configuration as well.

Pullrequests welcome, note that they might be edited with regards
to sites that they link to (e.g. community resources).

Please concentrate on linking existing resources and only very
brief summaries for topics - actual content should be authored
in different places. 

As the plugin is available for Liferay 7.2 only, and only in 
english language currently, the only content offered is for exactly
this setup: 7.2 and english.
